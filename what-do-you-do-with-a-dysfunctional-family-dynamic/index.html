Personally, I have acceptance. I have power to choose positive growth, I have the ability to sit with my feelings, and breathe through pain. </p><p>When I am with my family, I have problems, because my personal patterns no longer fit in with the dysfunctional dynamic we all learned. </p><p>My father's passing has catapulted all of us into the unknown. I wouldn't classify him as having full on NPD, but malignant narcissistic personality disorder, indeed. Coupled with what I now understand as my mother's patterns of co-dependency, it's no wonder I'm struggling with my family.</p><p>I loved my father dearly, and he truly loved all of us. I used to say that it would have been easier if he were awful, completely, so I could hate him. But I couldn't. He was kind and generous. He worked hard, all for his family. He would give time and energy and every last cent away, and he didn't do it for show. Since his passing, the shifting family dynamic has led me to research NPD much, much more than I ever had, as a means to figure out how to set my boundaries and still remain a part of my family in it's current state. I can see the ways my father went to these tendencies when stressed, and how my mother was the co-dependent portion to the terrible dynamic. Without him here, she doesn't know how to do anything. Without him here, it's more obvious how my dad kept my BIL's full blown NPD in check with his expectations. BIL wanted to be approved of by the head figure of our family. </p><p>I have so much love and compassion for my father, but it seems he always had a problem with me being my own person. I went to church every Sunday, plus weekly Catechism. I worked 5 days a week most weeks, paid for my own vehicle, gas, cell phone, and any long distance landline calls I would make. He would count them, and not only did I pay cash to him for them, I would have to tell him who it was, and often times, he would question me about why I would need to talk to this person for that long... he questioned why I hung out with anyone I hung out with. He questioned why I wanted to hang out with my boyfriend (per the rules), twice a week. I swear that once, he did something to my car, threatening that if I broke down on my way to my boyfriends that I shouldn't call him, he wouldn't come help me. I had just gotten paid, so the $50 in my wallet went to pay for a tow truck. </p><p>I always answered his questions. I was trained to, and not like a normal 16 or 17 year old. My mother groomed me to answer him. We feared him. I'd been thrown in a chair by my hair for trying to leave when he was belittling my grandmother. That was the first time I had a total breakdown. He wanted to have me admitted. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE. my mother stood between us and yelled at him to get away from me. I knew even then, with what little knowledge I had about life, adulthood, and mental well being, that what happened at home wasn't healthy, and it wasn't right. There was the occasional flipping of a table, smashing of a door... lots of yelling, questioning, finger pointing, belittling in the most insidious of ways. I would tell my dad I loved him until he said it back. </p><p>I got straight A's. I did all the work I was supposed to do. I did more. I worked hard and paid for things, tried to always ask for nothing. As if somehow, at some point, my dad would be happy with me. I knew he was proud of my accomplishments, my good grades, even my artistic tendencies that embraced punk music, heavy metal, and colorful hair and weird clothing. </p><p>Things change over time, but the underlying issues of pain that my dad felt, and the way I wished he could be happy, really didn't. I always tried. I talked to my parents, tried to educate them about their patterns and how they could change them. My mom always says she appreciates it. My dad would argue with me. I would cry. We all learned things. </p><p>I yearned to have my dad just accept me - check all the judgement at the door, it was just hurting him, hurting me, keeping us from a peaceful joy. And my entire family was driven towards this madness of trying to please my dad. I realize we were trained for it. I fought with him more than anyone else. I cried to him, and yelled at him, and got in my car and drove away more than once. I know that he felt bad, to begin with, which is why he acted the way he did, and that it made him feel worse. I don't regret any of the fights we had, because I feel like what I was fighting for was worth it - it was a fight to establish that I was worthwhile, just the way I was, and <i><b>so was he</b></i>. </p><p>When he passed, I could feel this struggle was gone. I feel that he is enlightened, free from all the suffering he was attached to in the physical world, from his childhood, through his life. He did so much good in his life, and expected the best from others - he was a teacher, a mentor, and someone that others looked up to. He was encouraging in many ways, and I had said, at his funeral, with my heart full of love for all the people there, that I never knew I had so many brothers and sisters. I hope that my dad stuck around to hear all the good things people had to say about him, about what he meant to them, about how he encouraged them and supported them when things were tough. He was a wonderful and kind person, but he was hard on himself, and those closest to him shared that burden. </p><p>I have learned not to embrace that anger over time. I have learned to embrace the kindness and also struggle not to live in the patterns of co-dependency. </p><p>More adjusted people will have no idea what my father's death means to us, because they have no idea what he meant to us in life. Unless you are partial to the inner workings of this kind of dynamic, you don't know how one's father can be a god - and how fear and love can be so closely entwined.</p><p>I focus on a very Buddhist meditation for him - my entire life, I wanted him to be joyful and at peace, and I feel this is something that his soul can experience now, free. </p><p>As for the rest of us... things have shifted. Things weren't exactly great before, but I hadn't realized how much my father was keeping in check. </p><p>My BIL has expanded his aggression, and his influence over the rest of my family. It has resulted in many very frustrating and upsetting situations for me. I love my family, and they have always been so very important to me. My siblings were my best friends. I would do anything for them. I have done anything for them. 4 am phone calls, random trips to pick them up, making the effort time and time again so that we could be together. It breaks my heart the most, that they've been hijacked from me, and that the NP manipulates them, so that they see me as something other, lesser, and most frustrating, as having agendas that I do not have, and never have had. </p><p>I have always been authentic in my care and kindness. If I mess things up, it's because I'm trying too hard to do too many things. One of my biggest faults is that I don't know how to say no, and I get myself into too much. But my heart? Fucking faultless. There are zero ulterior motives, manipulations, or hurtful intentions. Anyone who knows me should know this. </p><p>I worked really hard through my 20's to reflect and figure out how to get rid of all those pesky angry defense mechanisms that I learned growing up. I know that change is absolutely possible, but NPs don't typically admit fault or accept that they should change anything about themselves. </p><p>My sister has been placed in a tough spot, I guess. She, I presume subconsciously, has had to choose the NP over me, because she's married to him. He threatens her and controls her with emotional and financial abuse. I don't think she's aware of it. She was in an emotionally abusive relationship prior to her marriage, that lasted years, and was a mirror of my parents at the time. <br>NPs do this thing, which is something my dad did, and my mom defends, called contrasting. My dad's whole family does it. It's essentially the passive aggressive belittling of other people that shows the speaker in a more favored light. I happen to be one of the people being contrasted, my husband and I...and it's so subtle and pervasive that my family doesn't see it when it's happening. In fact, the NP employs so many of the NP tactics that even knowing, I can't get a handle on any conversation with him. I ended up crying numerous times because the NP was trying to convince me that my husband was cheating on me - I wasn't crying because I thought he was, I was crying because I was so frustrated that the NP was arguing with me about it, wouldn't listen to me, wouldn't back off, and had been discussing this with other people! </p><p>What this turns into for my family is that I am hard to talk to, and I won't listen to anything that I don't want to hear. </p><p>WEIRD. because I am capable of having all kinds of difficult conversations, and I take criticism incredibly well (hello, grad school, thank you very much) HOWEVER, I REFUSE TO BE BULLIED. I don't know how to tell them that I'll talk to them when they learn to communicate with me like civil human beings. <br>I have had lots of difficult conversations with people I love, and they do not involve me being mean, putting them down, or yelling at them and talking over them. </p><p>I take on too much, and spread myself too thin...apparently I'm not good at visualizing a realistic way to manage my resources, and this has gotten me into trouble - compiled with systematic oppression of the poor, the female, the ill... I just can't seem to get it all figured out. It doesn't mean that I'm not trying, and that I don't care. It doesn't mean that I don't want to listen, I just don't want to be abused. I have extended myself, my empathy on many occasions to my dear ones, and I'd just like some of that back. </p><p>I don't know how to explain this to them (because they'll just yell over me, or in my mother's case, defend defend defend into oblivion) I don't know how to tell my siblings that they're being manipulated, and it makes me angry. If these were their own opinions and feelings coming at me, it would be different, but as far as I recall, we were never hateful, competitive, hurtful, and there was never anything we couldn't work out - before. </p><p>I have to be this safe version of myself now. I have to play the game to be part of the group. My husband and I have to accept apologies we will never get. We have to prepare ourselves to leave if needed. I now always have an "escape plan". If the bullying starts, I refuse to participate. I get called "childish" for refusing to respond. When I get messages in a group text, calling me out on something the NP perceives is "my fault", and I don't respond by texting, but by calling my sister to resolve the matter because it's between me and her, I get yelled at, yelled over, and hung up on. "I'm sorry, but...." is NOT an apology. And formal words don't disguise the cruelty of all encompassing blame. </p><p>I don't know how to have a relationship with someone who holds me so low that everything I do is wrong, but still regards me as perfect enough to be doing it all on purpose. I can't even exist in that place. </p><p>I would be okay with being alienated from my entire family, if I knew they were happy. But that isn't the case. They're being manipulated and abused by an NP. Family therapy would be ideal, but there have to be willing participants. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">What do you do with a dysfunctional family dynamic?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
