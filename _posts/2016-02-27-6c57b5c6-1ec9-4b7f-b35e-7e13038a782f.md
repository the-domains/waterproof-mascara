I feel like too much a lot of the time.  
Like I'm too much emotion and feeling and thought for people to take in. I'm too excited about things, too passionate. I'm overly sensitive. I'm ready to embrace changes - and that scares the hell out of them. 

I want too much - connection, meaning, devotion, depth.

I care too much. 

I get looks like a wild animal, people aren't sure what it will do.

I feel misunderstood, like the people in my life can't comprehend my thoughts, and I'm too far beyond them now.

My fire burns away the nonsense too quickly, weakens all the walls. 

My heart is heavy, but so bright.

I offer something that most are not ready to accept the weight of.
