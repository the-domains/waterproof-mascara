  So I read A LOT. Researching things is natural for me - which is probably why
  I spent most of my life in school. Research helps me put experiences into

So I read A LOT. Researching things is natural for me - which is probably why I spent most of my life in school. Research helps me put experiences into context, sort out my feelings, and check with myself to make sure I'm feeling what is healthy to feel - and if not, what I can do about it. 

I go to research to take action, it helps me feel like I'm doing something, moving toward a solution to whatever problem there is. Not that I instantly find results, but it gives me more angles to consider, and more information on previous experiences to apply if they will...

My recent struggles with familial relationships are so complex, it's this maze that is truly difficult to navigate, and sometimes, I run into these crazy mirrors like the ones in so called "fun" houses at the carnival...

I was reading about ways that gaslighting is used, by individuals, and how it is used towards and individual by an entire familial group... I go through the list in the article, and as I'm doing so, I start to question if I do any of these things to my family members? After a few minutes, I laughed at the absurdity... I always check in on myself, but this IS what gaslighting DOES. It's not just a specific incident, but it's actually a way of behaving towards a person so subtly, so frequently, that they internalize the idea that what others did to them, maybe was their fault... I'm glad that I check myself to think about whether or not I'm actually hurting people, but even if they're blaming me for hurting them, directly or indirectly, I also realize that I'm a safe blame. They can't actually blame themselves or the person who orchestrates this symphony of madness, because it's not safe. 

It sucks, but I have to refuse to accept blame for things I didn't cause, or I'm just allowing that negative pattern to continue to run me over.
