I don't want to complain - so I end up not talking about my experiences. I think about what other people go through, and how they have their own struggles and losses, so I don't want to dump mine onto them. But still, if they're supposed to care about me, I should be able to. I think maybe I'm afraid to lose more than I've already lost...combined with the absolute lack of energy, speaking to someone else about my experiences feels like an exhausting idea right now.
