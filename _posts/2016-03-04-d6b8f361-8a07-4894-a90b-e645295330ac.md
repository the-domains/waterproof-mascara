I had a dream last night that was unusual for me. Instead of all the anxiety that is often present, I dreamt I was part of a swim team. We were training for hours on end, and I loved it. I could stay underwater for a really long time, and it all seemed to come naturally to me. 

There were 3 other girls in the dream, and our trainer was our teacher. It seemed this was college. I was going to do something else, but I remember telling my mother how much I enjoyed this, so I switched, and I wouldn't be doing the other thing. 

Our instructor was a man with dark hair and glasses. He really looked out for us, cared about us. I felt like I could breathe underwater, or like I didn't need to, there was no pressure in my chest or lungs. Then we got out of the pool, and they were draining it - there were large black holes in the pool bottom, we hadn't noticed them before. One of the girls whispered something to us about "what happened last year". There were faculty or administration there that were upset because of how much was spent on the pool the year before - it was all new. Our instructor seemed distraught. 

My dream slipped into his mind, and I could see what he was thinking - picturing the massacre that happened the last year. He seemed to be the only one who knew, and for some reason couldn't say anything. He was angry, and refused to let the same thing happen to us. He was picturing pale bloated bodies floating in the water... and there was a knowledge of some sort of wurm creature that was getting into the pool, it was what had killed the girls on the swim team last year. 

I wasn't going to let this deter me. I had found something there, and I was going to just keep swimming...
