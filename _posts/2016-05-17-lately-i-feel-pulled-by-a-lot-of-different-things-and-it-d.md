description: "Lately, I feel pulled by a lot of different things, and it distracts me from being able to concentrate on any of the things I want to be creating. It's a battle with my own body to get to a place where I'm capable of making things. I don't welcome these distractions, and it's a battle within my self to peel from my will and pay attention to these other things. I have a deep restlessness that is distracting me. All of the other things have made me scattered. I can't deal with other people's non-committal attitudes about problems that I'm trying to help them with. It results in restlessness for me because I have given my attention to them, to the thing, and then they choose inaction because it's easier. I want to choose myself, giving energy to what is calling, but having to give energy to what is pulling, because otherwise, I feel guilty, and that makes me more restless. "

Lately, I feel pulled by a lot of different things, and it distracts me from being able to concentrate on any of the things I want to be creating. It's a battle with my own body to get to a place where I'm capable of making things. I don't welcome these distractions, and it's a battle within my self to peel from my will and pay attention to these other things. I have a deep restlessness that is distracting me. All of the other things have made me scattered. I can't deal with other people's non-committal attitudes about problems that I'm trying to help them with. It results in restlessness for me because I have given my attention to them, to the thing, and then they choose inaction because it's easier. I want to choose myself, giving energy to what is calling, but having to give energy to what is pulling, because otherwise, I feel guilty, and that makes me more restless.
