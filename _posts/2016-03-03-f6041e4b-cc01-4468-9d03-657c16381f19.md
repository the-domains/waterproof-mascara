I find myself silent, so frequently, as of late. Bubbling into passionate moments where I can't hold back my meaning any longer - then regretting it - my words fall on deaf ears, my language is indecipherable to those who refuse to stop listening through walls - to listen at all.

My voice strains to find a proper receptacle to house it. The sounds fall inward, creating deeper hollows, avalanches tumbling, growling stone.
