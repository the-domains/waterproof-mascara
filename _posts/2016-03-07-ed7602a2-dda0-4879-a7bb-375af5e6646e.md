Daylight savings time is this weekend. You always made sure we didn't forget those things. You looked forward to the extended daylight, and noted how it would affect your day, when you got up, if it would be dark or light when you left and came home, what it would allow you to get done in a days time. There were never enough hours in the day for you, for us, for all the things we wanted to accomplish. There was never enough time. I am thankful for the time we had, and at a loss that it ran out. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed1005ea-8c29-4c77-a0e4-b04493f259cc.jpg)
